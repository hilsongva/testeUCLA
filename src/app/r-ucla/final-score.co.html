    Are you in the risk group?

      >This article by NBC News BETTER</a>
    suggests that people with R-UCLA score of 44 and more can be considered "officially lonely".

    (We'd like to tell you more, comparing your score against that of the other people over the world and in your region,
    but we'd need your support to do that. Please consider helping us <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cures">on Patreon</a>,
    sharing a word with us <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/8in9ik/revised_ucla_loneliness_scale/">on Reddit</a>
    or spreading the message).

      Since your score is 44 or higher the loneliness might be a risk factor for you.
      Recognising this is a first step in helping yourself
      (cf. <a href="https://youtu.be/_0hxl03JoA0?t=16m34s">John Cacioppo, TEDx talk "The lethality of loneliness"</a>).

    <p>
      Please don't stop there. Understand the risks and effects the loneliness brings, search for ways to respond.

    <p>
      Your score is 43 or lower.
      There's a good chance that loneliness is not your immediate concern.
      Keep it up!
