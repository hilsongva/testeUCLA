    Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale is widely used in scientific research
    as a proven measure of loneliness.
    It's 20 questions long but reliable.

    Loneliness is about perception.
    There are people who have little to no social support yet suffer
    neither the loneliness nor the physiological changes associated with it.
    The Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale reflects this by measuring the perception of loneliness,
    rather than a number of friends or similar social factors.
